# Open Source Security Policies and Procedures

This document outlines security procedures and general policies for my open
source projects as found on https://github.com/bbengfort.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for improving the
security of my open source software. I appreciate your efforts and responsible
disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report security vulnerabilities by emailing the Georgetown faculty at:

    benjamin@bengfort.com

I will do my best to get back to you as soon as possible - but keep in mind that
I'm just one person! While I work towards a fix, I will endeavor to keep
you informed of my progress and a full information. Any additional information
or guidance you could provide would be very helpful!

Report security vulnerabilities in third-party modules to the person or
team maintaining the module.
